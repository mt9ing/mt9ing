## 👋 Hey, I’m Mohamed

I build backends and full-stack apps that just work.  
I love writing clean TypeScript/Node.js (and lately, Bun!), and explaining code so it actually makes sense.

### 🚀 What I Do

- 🔧 Build real-world APIs, services & data pipelines  
- 🎓 Teach concepts clearly, step by step  
- 🧩 Manage projects end to end, from spec to launch  
- 🤝 Help devs level up—one question at a time

---

### 📂 What’s Here

- **Practical Projects** — code you can run today  
- **Mini-tools & Experiments** — fun side quests  
- **Guides & Examples** — learn by doing  
- **Contributions** — open-source I care about

I’m based in Egypt 🇪🇬 and always up for a chat about code, coffee, or the best way to slice a baguette 🥖.  
Feel free to explore and say hi!
